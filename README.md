# discord-bot
A discord bot I made using the discord.py module and is hosted on repl.it.
It can play tictactoe (although it is set up as insanely difficult; there is a bug to this)

You can add it by clicking this url: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=282274755426385921&scope=bot&permissions=8
