# Discord Bot
A discord bot (called El Chapo) I made using the discord.py module and is hosted on Repl.it (for now).

# Features

- Uses rewritten version (old_bot.py is the repl.it version)
- Tic-Tac-Toe (ultra difficult setting, there is a bug)
- Youtube search
- Plays music (in development)
- Twitter search (might be down)
- Virtual currency (not done yet)
- Can clear up to 100 messages in chat (needs Admin obviously)

# Future
- Set and get invite codes (currently only gets my invite code)
