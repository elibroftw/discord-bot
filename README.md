# Discord Bot
A discord bot (called El Chapo) I made using the discord.py module and is hosted on Repl.it (for now).

# Features

- Uses rewritten version (old_bot.py is the repl.it version)
- Tic-Tac-Toe (ultra difficult setting, there is a bug)
- Youtube search
- Plays music (in development)
    - Summon (!summon, !play <query/youtube_url>)
    - Queues (!play, !paly, !p, !queue, !que, !q)
    - Skip (!skip, !next, !s, !n)
    - Previous song (!previous, !back, !b)
    - Pause/Resume (!pause, !p, !resume)
    - Stop (!stop, !end)
    - Autoplay (!pap <query/youtube_url> (always turns it on), !auto_play, !ap)
    - Leave (!leave, !disconnect, !unsummon, !desummon, !dismiss)
    - Play next (adds the song to play right after, will rework this later !pn, !play_next)
    

- Twitter search (going to rework this)
- Virtual currency (not done yet)
